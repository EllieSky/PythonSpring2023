Lesson 6 Homework

Create a webdriver Data Driven test for a basic online calculator: https://www.theonlinecalculator.com/

For you test you will need to 
1) Create a browser session
2) Open the correct web page
3) Create a test (or tests) for (+) addition
4) Create a test (or tests) for (-) subtraction
5) Create a test (or tests) for (*) multiplication
6) Create a test (or tests) for (/) division

... Now identify the inputs and outputs, and convert into a single parameterized test with multiple data sets.

Hint: a locator for an element can also we "input data"
